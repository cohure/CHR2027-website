### Community

Want to stay in touch with the CHR community? Please sign up for the [CHR mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/chr-mailing)! Via this list, the board will share important updates with all members, and it also enables community members to circulate relevant vacancies, calls, and other announcements.

We are using Google Groups for this. You can join the Group using either a Gmail address or your institutional/work email address. In the latter case, please note that you need to link that address to a Google account before joining. More information on how to do this can be found on [this page](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205?hl=en).

### Contact
For questions, ideas, or support, contact the
[organizers](mailto:info@computational-humanities-research.org) or drop us a line on the
[forum](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org).
